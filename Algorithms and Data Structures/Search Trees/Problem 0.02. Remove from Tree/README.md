Based on the set of keys, build a binary search tree. Delete the key from it (right delete) if it is in the tree. Perform a direct left traversal of the resulting tree.

# Input
The first line contains an integer â€” the key to be removed from the tree.</br>

The second line is empty.</br>

The following lines contain a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order of addition to the tree. Keys are specified in one-per-line format. The tree contains at least two vertices.</br>

We remind you that in the search tree, all keys are by definition unique, so when you try to add a key that is already there, it is ignored.</br>

# Output
Output the sequence of keys of the vertices obtained by direct left traversal of the tree.</br>
