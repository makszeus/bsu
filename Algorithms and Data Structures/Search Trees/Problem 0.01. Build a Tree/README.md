Based on the set of keys, construct a binary search tree and perform its direct left traversal.

# Input
The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order of addition to the tree. Keys are specified in one-per-line format.

In a search tree, all keys are by definition unique, so when you try to add a key that is already there, it is ignored.

# Output
The output file should contain the sequence of keys of vertices obtained by direct left traversal of the tree.
