A ribbon with a width of one cell and a length of $n$ cells is specified. Some whole number is written on each cell. The game is played by two players who take turns. In one move, the player cuts off one of the outermost cells from the tape and takes it away. The game stops when the tape runs out. The player's winnings are equal to the sum of the numbers on the tape cells that he has. It is necessary to determine the amount of winnings that can be guaranteed to the player who starts the game first. (This is the amount of winnings that the first player secures for himself on any play by the second player.)

# Input
The first line contains the number $n$ $(1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).$ The next line contains the numbers of the tape (the numbers in the line are separated by a space).

# Output
A single line must contain an integer, the guaranteed winning amount of the player who starts the game first.
