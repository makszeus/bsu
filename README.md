# Belarusian State University
Repository for university labs on Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the Belarusian State University.</br>

#### 1-st course:
- [Fundamentals and Methodologies of Programming](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Fundamentals%20and%20Methodologies%20of%20Programming)

#### 2-nd course:
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Algorithms)
  - This course focuses on the fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures, how to design, analyze, and implement efficient algorithms for solving various computational problems. They will also learn about different data structures and their applications in computer science. The educational process uses the [iRunner 2](https://acm.bsu.by) Educational platform
- [Industrial Programming](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Industrial%20Programming)
  -  This course is designed to teach students the practical skills needed for industrial programming using Java, how to develop software applications using Java programming language, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. They will also learn about software development methodologies and tools commonly used in the industry.
- [Operating Systems](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Operating%20Systems)</br>
  - The course "Operating Systems" studies the principles of structural organization and construction of operating systems, as well as practical work with the system tools of the Windows operating system. The purpose of this course is to study the organization of operating systems, the principles of flow management, processes and the organization of data transfer between processes, as well as the management of virtual memory and files.

 
#### 3-rd course:
- [Computational Methods of Algebra](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Computational%20Methods%20of%20Algebra)
  - Computational Methods of Algebra include techniques for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (such as Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm, Simple Iteration Method, Jacobi Method, and Minimum Residual Method), as well as methods for solving eigenvalue problems (such as Danilevsky's Method, Krylov's Method, and Iterative Rotation Methods), among others.
- [Computer Modeling of Nanosystems](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Computer%20Modeling%20of%20Nanosystems)
  - In this course the following topics are covered: Numerical Optimization Methods, Calculation of Electric Fields in Semiconductor Nanostructures, Calculation of States in Single-Electron Nanoscale Structures and  Modeling Many-Electron Systems.
