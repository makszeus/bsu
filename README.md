# Belarusian State University
Repository for university labs, projects, works on Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the Belarusian State University.</br>

#### 1-st Course:
- [Fundamentals and Methodologies of Programming](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Fundamentals%20and%20Methodologies%20of%20Programming)
- [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Linear%20Algerba)

#### 2-nd Course:
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Algorithms)
  - This course focuses on the fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures, how to design, analyze, and implement efficient algorithms for solving various computational problems. They will also learn about different data structures and their applications in computer science. The educational process uses the [iRunner 2](https://acm.bsu.by) Educational platform
- [Industrial Programming](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Industrial%20Programming)
  -  This course is designed to teach students the practical skills needed for industrial programming using Java, how to develop software applications using Java programming language, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. They will also learn about software development methodologies and tools commonly used in the industry.
- [Operating Systems](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Operating%20Systems)</br>
  - The course "Operating Systems" studies the principles of structural organization and construction of operating systems, as well as practical work with the system tools of the Windows operating system. The purpose of this course is to study the organization of operating systems, the principles of flow management, processes and the organization of data transfer between processes, as well as the management of virtual memory and files.

 
#### 3-rd Course:
- [Coursework #1](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Course%20Work%201)
  - Numerical Simulation of Heat Propagation in a Homogeneous Sphere.
- [Coursework #2](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Course%20Work%202)
  - Difference Schemes for the Diffusion Equation.
- [Computational Methods of Algebra](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Computational%20Methods%20of%20Algebra)
  - Computational Methods of Algebra include techniques for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (such as Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm, Simple Iteration Method, Jacobi Method, and Minimum Residual Method), as well as methods for solving eigenvalue problems (such as Danilevsky's Method, Krylov's Method, and Iterative Rotation Methods), among others.
- [Computer Modeling of Nanosystems](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Computer%20Modeling%20of%20Nanosystems)
  - In this course the following topics are covered: Numerical Optimization Methods, Calculation of Electric Fields in Semiconductor Nanostructures, Calculation of States in Single-Electron Nanoscale Structures and  Modeling Many-Electron Systems.
- [Equations of Mathematical Physics](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Equations%20of%20Mathematical%20Physics)
  - 
- [Free-boundary Problems](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Free-boundary%20Problems)
  - Numerical methods for solving free boundary problems include several approaches and techniques aimed at finding solutions where the boundary of the domain is not fixed but determined during the solution process. These methods are commonly used in physics, engineering, finance, and other fields.
- [Functional Analysis and Integral Equations](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Functional%20Analysis%20and%20Integral%20Equations)
  - This course does not deal with individual objects such as functions or equations, but with large classes of spaces with the structure of vector spaces and operators in these spaces. This approach allows us to consider from a single point of view the problems of solving, for example, computational mathematics, to form abstract thinking in future specialists and to obtain the necessary knowledge base for its further application in various fields of knowledge. At present, the unifying role of functional analysis is generally recognised. 
- [Numerical Analysis](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Numerical%20Analysis)
  - 


#### 4-th Course:
- [Coursework #3](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Course%20Work%203)
- [Graduation Thesis](https://github.com/makszeus/bsu/tree/main/Graduation%20Thesis)
