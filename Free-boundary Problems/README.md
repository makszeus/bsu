# Free-boundary Problems

Approximation methods for solving nonlinear boundary value problems with an unknown (free) boundary are considered. A classic example of this type of problem is the Stefan problem in thermal conductivity theory. Examples of free boundary problems in thermophysics, hydrodynamics, etc. are given.
