In the file system of a personal computer, files are organized into directories. On a computer, a full file name is a string consisting of the directory names and the file name, separated by the \ symbol, and this symbol cannot occur twice in a row, nor can it be the first or the last. The file (directory) name can be of arbitrary length, but the full file name cannot contain more than $n$ characters. Symbols from the alphabet consisting of $k$ letters (the sign is not included) can be used as symbols that can be used in file (directory) names. For $k$ and $n$ data, it is necessary to determine the maximum number of $l$ files that can be written to a given computer.

# Input
A single line contains the numbers $k$ and $n$ $(1 ≤ k ≤ 49, 1 ≤ n ≤ 44),$ separated by a space.

# Output
Output the maximum number of $l$ files (guaranteed that $l ≤ 2 147 483 647$).
