There is a binary search tree in which the vertices' keys are integers in the range $−2^31$ to $2^31 − 1$ inclusive. Find the sum of the keys of all vertices of the tree.

# Input
The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order of addition to the tree. Keys are specified in one-per-line format.</br>

In a search tree, all keys are by definition unique, so when you try to add a key that is already there, it is ignored.

# Output
Output a single number - the sum of the keys in the constructed tree.
